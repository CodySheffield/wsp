        <h1>Samsung Galaxy NX</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Samsung Galaxy NX Mirrorless Digital Camera</strong> features a   20.3 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor and DRIMe IV image processor to produce   high resolution still imagery and full HD 1080p video at 30 fps with   notable low-light sensitivity to ISO 25600. Samsung's interchangeable   lens system allows this mirrorless camera to be paired with any lens in   the NX lineup. This unique camera runs on the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean   operating system and has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, and 3G/4G LTE mobile   connectivity—providing photographers with a wide range of image sharing   options.</p>
        <p>The Android operating system provides a familiar interface for   navigating system menus and camera functions, as well as putting a host   of downloadable apps at your fingertips. Additionally, photos and videos   can be automatically backed up using cloud storage. For further   personalization, the Camera Studio widget helps to integrate camera   functions with downloaded apps and allows the Galaxy NX's capture modes   and edit settings to be customized.</p>
        <p>Complementing the range of options for mobile connectivity, the   Galaxy NX camera is equipped with a pop-up flash and integrated GPS, as   well as a 0.46" electronic viewfinder and a 4.8" TFT-LCD touchscreen.   The camera's Advanced Hybrid Autofocus system combines phase detection   AF and contrast AF technologies to create a system capable of capturing   images with impressive focus accuracy and almost no shutter lag.<br>
          <br>
          Included with the camera body is the Samsung NX-mount 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6   OIS lens that provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of   27.7-84.7mm, covering wide-angle to telephoto perspectives. The OIS   image stabilization system helps to minimize the appearance of camera   shake and the inclusion of iFunction control enables lens-based   adjustments of some of the most oft-used camera settings.</p>

          <h3>Image Quality and Performance</h3>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>20.3MP APS-C CMOS Image Sensor</strong></dt>
          <dd> A large 20.3 megapixel APS-C CMOS image sensor and DRIMe IV   image processor work together to produce high resolution imagery and   full HD 1080p video at 30 fps with impressive low-light quality and   sensitivity to ISO 25600. The size of the sensor also helps to produce   images with reduced noise and clarity as well as promoting greater   control over depth of field and selective focus placement. The DRIMe IV   image processor also affords a wealth of speed throughout the camera   system, including a continuous shooting rate up to 8.6 fps and a top   shutter speed of 1/6000th of a second. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Hybrid Autofocus System</strong></dt>
          <dd> The Advanced Hybrid Autofocus system utilizes both phase- and   contrast-detection focusing methods to acquire focus quickly and   precisely. The phase-detection method is ideal for gaining focus in an   expedited manner while contrast-detection is employed to fine-tune the   focus for critical applications. When combined, focusing is sharp and   leads to making photos in a natural and intuitive manner. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Samsung NX Lens Mount</strong></dt>
          <dd> A broad array NX-mount of lenses are available for use, ranging   from wide-angle primes to long-reaching zooms. The ability to change and   utilize different lenses depending on the situation at hand aids in   producing captivating and more dynamic imagery. Additionally, the Galaxy   NX is compatible with the unique 45mm f/1.8 2D/3D lens that enables   one-lens creation of true 3D photos and movies. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Samsung 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 OIS Lens</strong></dt>
          <dd> Included with the camera body is the standard zoom 18-55mm   f/3.5-5.6 OIS lens, which provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length range   of 27.7-84.7mm. This wide-angle to telephoto perspective range is   well-suited to everyday shooting and the inclusion of OIS image   stabilization benefits working in low-light conditions and with greater   zoom magnifications. One aspherical element is also incorporated into   the lens construction to minimize chromatic aberrations and contribute   to higher image quality. The lens supports iFunction control, which   enables lens-based adjustment of many common camera settings, including   shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and more by simply pressing the button and   rotating the control ring; allowing you to keep your eye to the   viewfinder while adjusting an array of settings. </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Wireless Efficiency</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Wi-Fi and 3G/4G LTE Connectivity</strong></dt>
          <dd> In addition to Wi-Fi connectivity, the Galaxy NX also integrates   3G/4G LTE support to enable sharing of imagery from nearly anywhere at   any time. This ability allows uploading of files to social networking   sites, emailing photos to friends, or backing up images on cloud-based   storage sites. Additionally, Android apps can be downloaded directly to   the camera to enables a wide range of in-camera editing and presentation   solutions. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Photo Suggest</strong></dt>
          <dd> The Photo Suggest function can instantly connect you to   wide-ranging libraries of images taken by other photographers in your   current location. This allows for direct, real time reference of other   images and helps to provide suggestions as to how to photograph a   specific scene. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Story Album</strong></dt>
          <dd> The Story Album function helps to create, display, and print   photo albums of groups of imagery from within the camera. This tool will   automatically organize photos into timelines and will then reframe and   resize images in order to produce digital photo books for sharing and   viewing online. </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Intuitive and Familiar Operation</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Android 4.2 Jelly Bean</strong></dt>
          <dd> The Galaxy NX utilizes the familiar and powerful Android 4.2   Jelly Bean operating system to create an efficient and easy-to-navigate   user-interface for controlling camera functions and for seamless sharing   of imagery. Access to a wide network of Android apps is available for   personalized fine-tuning of files and a multitude of options for output   and sending. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Camera Studio</strong></dt>
          <dd> The Camera Studio widget helps to customize camera settings for   creating, editing, and presenting photos in a unique and simple manner.   You can save and easily access your favorite shooting modes and employ   helpful tools such as the location-based apps like Photo Suggest,   TourWrist, and TripAdvisor; presentation-based Gallery and Story Album   tools; and photo and video editing apps such as Video Maker and Paper   Artist. Additionally, Dropbox can be used as a functional means for   storing and sharing imagery with a wide audience. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Smart Mode</strong></dt>
          <dd> The Smart Mode button provides access to a host of automatic,   intelligent camera settings that can be employed to help optimize your   imagery in any setting:<br>
            <li>Drama Shot merges continuous shots of moving objects into a single composed frame.</li>
            <li>Action Freeze works to ensure still and clear rendering of fast-moving subjects.</li>
            <li>Light Trace allows for creative long exposures to be made in which the subject can produce creative effects with light.</li>
            <li>Multi Exposure automatically composites two images into a single blended frame.</li>
            <li>Sound & Shot enables the attachment of recorded sound along with a still image for creative, multi-media results.</li>
